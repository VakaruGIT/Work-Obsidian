- REFLECTION
    
    Main Problems:
    
    1. Didn’t take notes (too invested visually)
    
    1. Thought I understood everything when actually it was the opposite
    
    1. Didn’t know how to sell my solution (explanation)
    
    1. Visually present a process instead of showing notes or findings
    
    1. Stressed out when couldn’t find answer to question
    
    Solution to these problems:
    
    - Take notes on main problem (cause, possible solutions, expectations)
    
    - Ask questions during this process
    
    - Even if you think everything was crystal clear, ask if this what the person meant
    
    - Create Mockups or visually represent your idea instead of just talking
    
    - Keep calm and try to understand why the person doesn’t get what you are explaining
