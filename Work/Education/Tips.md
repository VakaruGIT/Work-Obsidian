        Work centers can be splitted (key attribute)
        
        How does the production happens
        
        - WE need to understand this process
        
        Different number of instances of the class (work center)
        
        Different techniques
        
        Diagram with connections between the datasets (how are they connected)
        
        Explain why rows are less in different datasets and how are they providing more work instances in the others (what is the relation, very detailed)
        
        pseudocode for the generation part (flow diagram)
        
        knowledge gained before creating the dataset
